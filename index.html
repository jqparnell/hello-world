    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Jackie, but I also go by Moria online. My handle is usually @moriafriend on whatever social media I might be on. I love drawing, music, archeology, astronomy, coding, and crafting.</p>
    <h2>Selections from CWD Index</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://mrdoob.com/#/117/fire">Fire</a>
        <p>My first choice is this animation work called <em>Fire</em>, which has a roaring fire at the bottom of the screen, and creates a trail of fire wherever you click. It's fun to do elegant patterns.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.geokitten.com/">Geo Kitten</a>
        <p>My second choice is the online work called <em>Geo Kitten</em>, which takes you through a series of kitten photos that "reveal your location". The actual way it knows your location is through IP address.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land</a>
        <p>My final choice is the dynamic work called <em>Native Land</em>, which is an app that maps Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages. I find this very useful, and wish it was more widespread.</p>
