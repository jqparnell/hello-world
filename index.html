    <h1>Hello, World...</h1>
    <p>...my name is Jacqueline Parnell! I have been a digital artist for about a decade.
      <br> I love music, drawing, archeology, astronomy, coding, and crafting.
      <br> From an early age, I hung around on the internet, practicing safety and staying in my lane. 
      <br> I have always had an interest in scripting and coding. 
      <br> The internet feels like home already, so learning how to build within it feels appropriate. </p>

    <h2>Selections from CWD Index</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="https://mrdoob.com/#/117/fire">Fire</a></h3>
        <p>My first choice is this animation work called <em>Fire</em>, which has a roaring fire at the 
          <br>bottom of the screen, and creates a trail of fire wherever you click.  
          <br>It's fun to do elegant patterns.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="https://www.geokitten.com/">Geo Kitten</a></h3>
        <p>My second choice is the online work called <em>Geo Kitten</em>, which takes you through 
          <br>a series of kitten photos that "reveal your location". 
          <br>The actual way it knows your location is through IP address.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land</a></h3>
        <p>My final choice is the dynamic work called <em>Native Land</em>, which is an app that 
          <br>maps Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages. 
          <br>I find this very useful, and wish it was more widespread.</p>
